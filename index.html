        <p>
          Indent Labs is a collection of ambitious natural language processing projects
          aimed squarely at moonshots in the field of writing, particularly at the intersection of
          artificial intelligence and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Projects in our pipeline include dynamic prose and poetry generation, in-story analysis and analytics,
          real-time writing guidance and feedback, alternative storytelling mediums, new ways to interact with and
          bring characters to life, and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first word processor showed up in the 60's and revolutionized writing through
          technology. Isn't it time for another shift forward?

        <p>
          These projects are still in active development. They may or may not ever see the light of
          day (depending on whether we can get cutting-edge tech behind them working!), but they're here
          to give you an idea of the kind of projects Indent Labs is working on.

        <h4>
          Write like the stars
        </h4>
        <p>
          Ghost is a web-based editor for ghostwriters and niche writers that builds off of
          Dactyl's rich linguistic fingerprinting. Pick a target author and see in real time
          – as you write – how similar your writing style is to theirs, and what suggestions
          Ghost has to match them even closer.

          Word super-processor

        <p>
          Asimov needs a better phrase than "word processor", but that's a great start to
          explaining its functionality. Past all the usual functionality, this editor also
          does entity recognition to figure out who, where, when, and what you're writing
          about and can show unobtrusive contextual information that's
          relevant to what you're writing about&mdash;without breaking your flow.

          grudingly agree. Ankov is an entity – a chatbot, a user, a <em>peer</em> – that's

          all communities it finds across the web.

        <p>
          Prompt utilizes AI to generate randomized writing prompts, optimized for the writer
          generating them. Ideas can be pulled from content stored in Notebook.ai, morphed from your
          existing stories, incorporate trending story topics, or pull from a multitude of other

          Through silicon-tinted glasses

        <p>
          Procedurally generated stories have always been stuff of science fiction, but no longer.
          From an outline (writer-supplied or generated), Story melds common character
          archetypes with universal plot arcs to dynamically generate prose for delightful
          human consumption.

        <h4>
          Autoreviewer tagline
        </h4>
        <p>
          Nearly 50% of most first- and second-pass copy editing corrections happen repeatedly,
          and can be automated with a simple set of rules built on Dactyl's analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Autoreviewer aims not to replace copy and line editors, but rather to augment their
          workflow and free up their time from small corrections to focus on more complex
          critique that makes great stories even better.

          Manuscript formatting as a service

        <p>
          Every publisher wants your manuscript formatted <em>slightly</em> differently. Different
          file formats, headers, footers, page sizes, margins, titles, and so on. Convert does
          that all for you; just upload your manuscript, choose which publishers you're submitting to,
          and it's done!

        <p>
          Submit walks writers through the arduous process of preparing their manuscripts for
          publication. After revising, reviewing, formatting, and soliciting publishers, authors can
          track their submission status and estimated response time. Submit handles the
          typically required snail-mail correspondence for you and provides a simple web interface
          for your new career as an author.
