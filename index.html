        <p>
          Indent Labs is a collection of ambitious natural language processing projects
          aimed squarely at moonshots in the field of writing, particularly at the intersection of
          artificial intelligence and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Projects in our pipeline include dynamic prose and poetry generation, in-story analysis and analytics, real-time writing guidance and feedback, alternative storytelling mediums, new ways to interact with and bring characters to life, and so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first word processor showed up in the 60's and revolutionized writing through
          technology. Isn't it time for another shift forward?

          Ghost is a web-based editor for ghostwriters and niche writers that builds off of
          Dactyl's rich linguistic fingerprinting. Pick a target author and see in real time

          We jokingly call Ankov the Internet Beast, but there are some out there who might

          all communities it finds across the web.

        <h4>

        <p>
          Prompt utilizes AI to generate randomized writing prompts, optimized for the writer
          generating stem. Ideas can be pulled from content stored in Notebook, morphed from your
          existing stories, incorporate trending story topiccs, or pull from a multitude of other

          Through machine-tinted glasses
        </h4>
        <p>
          Procedurally generated stories have always been stuff of science fiction, but no longer.
          From an outline (writer-supplied or generated), Story melds common character
          archetypes with universal plot arcs to dynamically generate prose for delightful
          human consumption.

          Autoreviewer tagline
        </h4>
        <p>
          Nearly 50% of most first- and second-pass copy editing corrections happen repeatedly,
          and can be automated with a simple set of rules built on Dactyl's analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Autoreviewer aims not to replace copy and line editors, but rather to augment their
          workflow and free up their time from small corrections to focus on more complex
          critique that makes great stories even better.

          Manuscript formatting as a service

        <p>
          Every publisher wants your manuscript formatted <em>slightly</em> differently. Different
          file formats, headers, footers, page sizes, margins, titles, and so on. Convert does
          that all for you; just upload your manuscript, pick the format you want, and it's done!

        <p>
          Submit walks writers through the arduous process of preparing their manuscripts for
          publication. After revising, reviewing, formatting, and soliciting publishers, authors can track their submission status and estimated response time. Submit handles the
          typically required snail-mail correspondence for you and provides a simple web interface
          for your new career as an author.

          Superhuman reading
        </h4>
        <p>
          Reader is a simple, web-based app that minimizes the unfortunately necessary delay
          your eyes require to scan for each sequential word while reading. Instead, Reader
          positions words using ORPs (optimal recognition points) in a fixed position, allowing
          readers to easily read up to 600 words per minute – triple the average person's reading
          speed.
